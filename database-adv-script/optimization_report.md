\# Query Optimization Report



\## Objective

Refactor complex queries to improve performance by reducing execution time through optimized joins, indexing, and query structure.



\## Initial Query Analysis



\### Query Description

The initial query retrieves all bookings along with comprehensive user details, property details, host information, payment details, and review information.



\### Performance Issues Identified



\#### 1. \*\*Unnecessary Data Retrieval\*\*

\- Selecting 30+ columns including large text fields (descriptions, amenities, comments)

\- Retrieving all historical data without date filtering

\- Including rarely used fields like latitude/longitude, date\_of\_birth



\#### 2. \*\*Inefficient JOIN Operations\*\*

\- Multiple LEFT JOINs on large tables (payments, reviews)

\- No filtering on joined tables

\- Cartesian product risk with multiple many-to-one relationships



\#### 3. \*\*Missing WHERE Clause\*\*

\- No date range filtering, scanning entire bookings history

\- No status filtering for active records only



\#### 4. \*\*Large Result Set\*\*

\- LIMIT 1000 still requires processing all records for sorting

\- No pagination strategy



\#### 5. \*\*Index Gaps\*\*

\- Missing composite indexes for common query patterns

\- No covering indexes for frequently accessed columns
