# ALX Airbnb Database Project

## Project Overview
This project contains the **database design and Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for an Airbnb-like system.  
The goal is to define the core entities, their attributes, relationships, and constraints required for managing users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, and messaging.

---

## Objective
- Design a relational database schema for an Airbnb clone.
- Identify all entities, attributes, and relationships.
- Create a visual **ER Diagram** representing the database structure.
- Ensure the database design meets **ALX specifications** for constraints, indexes, and relationships.

---

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand **entity-relationship modeling** for a real-world application.
- Apply **database normalization principles**.
- Implement **constraints** like primary keys, foreign keys, enums, and unique indexes.
- Visualize database structures with **Mermaid or Draw.io ERD** diagrams.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mouradpy/alx-airbnb-database.git
   
**Think of it like this:**
- **ONE** `README.md` file in the **main folder**
- Contains **ALL** the sections together
- The "Technology Stack", "ER Diagram", and "How to Use" sections are just **parts** of the complete README

**To fix this right now:**

1. Open your complete `README.md` file:
   ```cmd
   code README.md
